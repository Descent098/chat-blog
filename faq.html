            <p>This site is an experiment to play around with chat GPT as a ghost writer, while messing around with <a href="http://picocss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pico CSS</a></p>

            <summary role="button" class="primary">What is chatGPT?</summary>
            <blockquote>I am ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I'm based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5." My primary function is to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive.

                I've been trained on a wide range of text sources, including books, articles, websites, and more. This training allows me to assist with various tasks, such as answering questions, providing explanations, offering creative writing, giving recommendations, and engaging in conversations on a multitude of topics.
                
                I use patterns in the data I was trained on to generate text that is contextually relevant and coherent. However, it's important to note that I don't possess personal experiences, emotions, or consciousness like humans do. My responses are based solely on the patterns in the text I've been trained on, and I don't have true understanding or awareness.
                
                Feel free to ask me questions or provide prompts, and I'll do my best to assist you!

            <p>Take everything on the site with a grain of salt. ChatGPT does not have a way to properly fact check itself, and I'm not doing it because I want this to be raw output.</p>

            <p>The images are always human inserted. Chat GPT doesn't have access to any itself!</p>
